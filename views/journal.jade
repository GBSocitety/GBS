        | We publish research conducted by undergraduate engineering students in order to encourage intellectual exploration across the various engineering disciplines. We seek to contribute to the scientific community by publishing articles that have scientific merit and also are of interest to the general engineering research community. We are committed to publishing high-quality research, and all articles will be peer reviewed using a double-blind process. We are always looking for interested students to join our editorial team. Abstract submission will open in September.
